Welcome to [b]K[/b]indle [b]U[/b]nified [b]A[/b]pplication [b]L[/b]auncher, your [i]/kuːl/[/i] friendly neighborhood Launcher ;).

[COLOR="DarkGreen"][b]What Does It Do?:[/b][/COLOR]
[INDENT]
As the name implies, this is a Launcher application, in which anybody can plug into to provide new [i]buttons[/i] and [i]menus[/i] through [i]extensions[/i]. Those buttons can run pretty much anything, and the backend is powerful enough to make menus dynamic, allowing developers to use KUAL as a configuration UI for their stuff! But the basic principle is: click a button to run stuff!

A number of hacks ship with a KUAL extension, which is why you'll often see KUAL listed as a required dependency ;).

Moreover, it's universal! It'll run on (pretty much) anything, as long as it's running FW >= 2.3! [COLOR="DarkGrey"]With a particular caveat on the KT2/KV/PW3, where some early firmware versions won't let you run it...[/COLOR] And a fun twist on the KOA/KT3, more on that later...
[/INDENT]


[COLOR="Red"][b]Latest Updates (07/21/2016):[/b][/COLOR]
[INDENT]
KUAL v2.7. Oasis & KT3 support, via a Booklet port. Do read the relevant part of the documentation.
[/INDENT]


[COLOR="Red"][b]INSTALL:[/b][/COLOR]

[b]KUAL itself:[/b]
[INDENT][SPOILER]
As pretty much anything here, your device will need to be jailbroken. Please refer to the wiki and/or the [url=http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=180113]stickies[/url] & index for the appropriate method for your specific Kindle model ;).

In addition, you [i]may[/i] need to install [url=http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=233932]MKK[/url]: if your device runs on FW 5.x, and you're using the [url=http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=186645]K5 JB >= 1.11.N[/url] (or the associated "hotfix"), you don't need to do anything, MKK is bundled with your JB. If you're using an older device, you [i]will[/i] need to install MKK yourself ;).

Finally, you need to install KUAL itself, by putting the appropriate [i]azw2[/i] file somewhere in the [i]documents/[/i] directory tree of your device.
First, unpack the [b]KUAL-v2.7.zip[/b] archive attached to this post. Then, if your device runs on FW 5.x, use the [b]KUAL-KDK-2.0.azw2[/b] file. If your device is older, use the [b]KUAL-KDK-1.0.azw2[/b] file.

And that's it for the basics! You should now have a pretty KUAL button/entry on your Library (on recent FW, make sure you switch to the [i]local[/i] Library view. In the same vein, on FW using a dedicated Homescreen page, you will [i]never[/i] see KUAL in it). Right now, it won't be terribly useful, since KUAL ships without any extension, but now you have the tools to change that :).
Check the screenshots attached to this post for a quick tutorial on how to actually navigate KUAL's UI ;).
[/INDENT][/SPOILER]

[COLOR="Red"][b]Important notice for KOA/KT3 owners:[/b][/COLOR]
[INDENT][SPOILER]
As of right now, and for reasons outside of our control, Kindlets will fail to run on these devices, so you can disregard the earlier bit about the [i]azw2[/i] file.

Instead, on these devices, we will have to use the Booklet version of KUAL.

First, the prerequisites: your device of course still needs to be jailbroken, and needs to be running a recent "[url=http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=3004892&postcount=1597]hotfix[/url]" version [COLOR="DarkGrey"](the vast majority of you should be covered, only the early adopters might need to update their hotfix)[/COLOR]. Then, you will have to install [url=http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=251143][b]MR Package Installer[/b][/url] (MRPI). Never mind that it's technically a KUAL extension and that we're in effect doing things in reverse ;).

Once that's done, put the [b]Update_KUALBooklet_v*_install.bin[/b] file (found in the same archive as mentioned earlier) in the [i]mrpackages[/i] folder, which you'll find at the root of your Kindle over USB, then eject & unplug you Kindle.

Finally, enter [b];log mrpi[/b] in the Homescreen's searchbar (in a similar fashion as what you had to do during the Jailbreak), and wait for MRPI to do its thing.
When the UI finishes restarting, you should end up with a KUAL entry in your Library (showing as a personal document).
[/INDENT][/SPOILER]

[b]KUAL extensions:[/b]
[INDENT][SPOILER]
Let's take the 'Helper' extension attached to this post as an example. Simply unpack the [b]kual-helper-0.5.N.zip[/b] archive attached to this post at the USB root of your device. It'll create an [i]extensions[/i] folder, and a [i]helper[/i] subdirectory in it. That's it! Each extension lives as its own subdirectory inside the [i]extensions[/i] folder. It'll automagically get picked up the next time your start KUAL, and you should see a new 'Helper' menu pop up in the main KUAL screen!

Extensions should always be packaged this way (i.e., simply unpack them at the root of your device), but if they're not, unpack them inside the [i]extensions[/i] directory instead.
Developers, see [url=http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/KUAL_What%27s_New]this wiki page[/url] for all the gory details on what you can do ;).

Here are a few other 'quality-of-life' extensions provided by the KUAL dev-team:
[url=http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=2591705&postcount=1014][b]KUAL+[/b][/url], which extends the KUAL menu with more configuration options for KUAL itself.
[url=http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=2636883&postcount=50][b]GNU Awk Installer[/b][/url], which will provide an install button for gawk in the KUAL menu. gawk will then be used by KUAL, instead of busybox awk. Long story short: it'll make KUAL parse your extensions faster, which is good ;). It's [b]highly[/b] recommended, especially if you use complex KUAL extensions.
[url=http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=251143][b]MR Package Installer[/b][/url], which will make installing your favorite set of hacks a breeze ;).

[COLOR="Red"][b]FAQs and Known Issues:[/b][/COLOR]
[INDENT][SPOILER]
[b]Q[/b]. Halp! Everything is broken, and my device shows me a weird popup when I try to launch KUAL!
The content of the popup might range from "This device is not authorized as a test Kindle by the developer of this item", to "Mobileread Kindlet Kit is not installed"

[b]A[/b]. You either fell victim to a silent OTA update, or you unregistered your device since the last time you tried to launch a Kindlet.
The fix is simple: reinstall MKK. (On devices where you installed the "hotfix" at some point in time, a simple reboot might do the trick).

----

[LIST]
[*]Non-Japanese 4GB PW2 models won't run Kindlets at all [you'll get a "The selected application cannot be started. Please try again later" popup], unless updated to 5.4.5 or newer (make sure you're JailBroken [i]before[/i] updating).
[*]In the same vein, on the KV, the KT2 & the PW3, some early FW versions won't let you run Kindlets at all [you'll get a "The selected application cannot be started. Please try again later" popup].
[*]Still in the same vein, do read the dedicated Oasis & KT3 section if you own one of these devices.
[*]On a cold boot, even with everything in order, KUAL [i]may[/i] sill fail to start on the first try, usually with a "An error occurred while trying to open this item", or a "The selected application cannot be started. Please try again later" or "Kindlet did not shut down properly" popup. This is a known issue, stemming from restrictions of the Kindlet framework, and the way in which KUAL is designed. Simply try again a bit later. (On a sidenote, enabling [url=http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=2636883&postcount=50][b]gawk[/b][/url] [i]might[/i] help a bit).
[*]Really old firmware versions on the K2 & DX did not support Kindlets, update the firmware to the latest version available.
[*]Frankensteined DXG with FW 3.x won't be able to run Kindlets without [url=http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=1747631&postcount=354]further tinkering[/url]
[*]You [i]need[/i] an up to date JailBreak (>= 1.13.N) in order for your extensions to behave properly on FW >= 5.6.1. If stuff appears to be half-broken, that's probably the case (the breadcrumb line being prefixed with a [i]%[/i] is a definite sign that your JB is outdated).
[*]If some buttons mysteriously fail to run, in an apparently random fashion, make sure your host system and/or your unarchiving tools are not messing with the case and the line-endings of files when unpacking the archives... This is sure to lead to hair-pulling mysteries otherwise ;).
[*]On newer FW, if you can't seem to find the KUAL button/entry, make sure you switch to a [i]local[/i] Library view. Don't hesitate to filter by "Active Content" if you [i]really[/i] can't seem to find it.

[B]FAQ[/B]:
[COLOR="White"][SPOILER][COLOR="Black"][COLOR="Black"][B]What stage is the project at?[/B]
It's at a release stage. [B]Stable[/B]. [/COLOR]

[B]Anything I should know?[/B]
You should only ever run code on your device from [COLOR="Red"]trusted sources[/COLOR]. Code run via this launcher is no exception. We accept no responsibility and expect you to be [COLOR="red"]vigilant and mindful[/COLOR] of any custom code you choose to run on your machine.

[B]Removing unwanted entries from menu[/B]
If you have a menu item you don't want. simply renaming the correct /mnt/us/extensions/<application name>/[B]config.xml[/B] and[B] menu.json [/B]to [B]config-skip.xml[/B] and [B]menu-skip.json[/B] will remove them from the lists next load.   or delete the offending folders. your call.

[B]Adding things to the menu[/B]
Simply construct a pair of [B]config.xml[/B] and[B] menu.json [/B] in it's own application subfolder under /mnt/us/extensions/<application name>/ just like before. The launcher should now parse it.
At a minimum point the menu.json to run at least one thing (like say a shell script) to be actually useful.[/COLOR]

[url]http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/KUAL_What's_New[/url] Contains a whole BUNCH of good information for developers about how to use the new KUAL 2.x menu system. Give that a read too.

[COLOR="Black"][B]How do I convert my Launchpad scripts?[/B][/COLOR]
[COLOR="Black"]There is a [URL="http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=2406316&postcount=5"]basic guide to converting the launchpad calls[/URL] to menu items.
Currently we don't auto-parse the launchpad folder. So this process is required to support applications on the older (pre Touch) devices.[/COLOR]

[COLOR="Black"]
[B]How Do I Exit?[/B]
[COLOR="Black"][B]The kindlet will [I]generally[/I] exit when you click a choice[/B]
Currently just press the [B]HOME key[/B] if you have one or the[B] [SIZE="5"]<[/SIZE] [/B] icon.
[B] Or select an item, the menu is [I]generally[/I] self-terminating.[/B]
There [I]is[/I] an option to make kual non-suicide on a per application basis, configurable in the startup configs. The "USBNetworking suite" demonstrates this in action.

[COLOR="Black"][B]I Have a Keyboard Device... Any Shortcuts?[/B][/COLOR]
Key-bindings have been added for devices with keys; [B]PAGE forward and back now do what you expect and the top row (say q, w, e, r, etc.) will SELECT "options" (i.e KUAL BUTTONS) 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.  Which is nice. [/COLOR][/B][/COLOR]

[B]Anything I might not have read above that I [COLOR="Red"][B]really should have[/B][/COLOR]?[/B][COLOR="Silver"][QUOTE=SUPPORT ADVICE][COLOR="Black"]
[SIZE="1"]Since most of the support requests are about the initial [I][B]installation[/B][/I] this section has been expanded to hopefully make it [B][COLOR="DarkRed"]perfectly clear[/COLOR][/B]. [/SIZE]
[COLOR="Red"]Before[/COLOR] you ask for support: Have you installed the [B]Mobileread Kindlet Kit?[/B] It is [B]REQUIRED[/B].
[COLOR="White"][SPOILER][COLOR="Black"]
You [B]MUST[/B] install the Mobileread Kindlet Kit!!!!!!!!!!!!!

See the [URL=http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=233932]MKK Thread[/url].
It is really required. Like really. You NEED it.
The large error messages will be a clue if you forget this step.
You install it using the UPDATE MY KINDLE option in HOME>SETTINGS[/COLOR]
[/SPOILER][/COLOR][SIZE="1"]Don't expect support if you haven't installed it other than "[B]Install it[/B]!"[/SIZE][/COLOR][/QUOTE][/COLOR][B]So by this point you should be 100% ready to install everything...[/B]
Give it a go... :)

[SIZE="1"]We maintain lists of known issues and other exciting details below.[/SIZE] Enjoy the App.

[B]Testing, errata, one last time...[/B]
[COLOR="White"][SPOILER][COLOR="Black"]There are a couple of apps that don't play nicely - [B][I]xterm for example on the PW & PW2 must be replaced by [URL="http://www.fabiszewski.net/kindle-terminal/"]Kterm[/URL]. [/I][/B] Documenting these corner cases would go a long way towards knowing what needs to be fixed. Some efforts to this end are being made in the[B] 3rd Party Support Notes[/B] section below.
Feel free to add comments about amending that as needed.

This is in the Release phase right now for K2, K2i, DX, K3, K4, Touch, PW, PW2, KV, KT2 & PW3 devices, support is confirmed for these devices and it is safe to use the installers on them.

You can follow the project updates and grab the source here: [URL="https://bitbucket.org/ixtab/kindlelauncher/overview"]Kindle Launcher Git[/URL]

Also Attached [I]as described above[/I] is the "Helper" extensions package.

However: DO, Simply un-archive the HELPER package and place the resulting "extensions" folder and it's contents in your [B]FAT ROOT[/B] to get started with a few "Helper" links. Get you going with a few buttons.[/COLOR]
[/SPOILER][/COLOR]

[COLOR="White"][SPOILER][COLOR="Black"]
Thanks to KNC1 for download authentication support, support hosting and all his tireless help developing the modules, structure and concepts for kual-system.
wakawakawaka for testing the DX prerequisites.
All the application authors who took the time to provide support.
All those kind users who were good enough to provide extensions for their favourite apps.
Yifan was the original chap whoms configs we parse.
All the unsung demo authors whose work we draw from on a daily basis.
And everyone else along the way.[/COLOR]

[B]SOLUTION[/B][COLOR="White"][spoiler][COLOR="Black"] This happens generally after:
[LIST]
[*]A change in the install of MKK. [SIZE="1"][COLOR="Gray"](following a failed previous "open" attempt)[/COLOR][/SIZE]
[*]A newly installed application ends with a bang.
[*]You restart your kindle while the app is running somehow (ssh, rebootApp, etc)
[/LIST]
Just press on "OK" then "Home" [I][B]IN TIME[/B][/I], or suffer the reboot :smack:

Simply opening KUAL again (after you dismissed the message) will work just fine. Very rare. Benign. This is actually the Amazon framework doing [B]it's job correctly[/B] and alerting us we had an issue. [COLOR="Gray"]IIRC there is some way of auto-clearing the notification but this seems contrary[/COLOR]. Therefore  "Won't fix".[/COLOR][/spoiler][/COLOR][/COLOR][/SPOILER][/COLOR][COLOR="White"]

Much of these issues are [B]bit rot[/B] of old extensions... not the launchers failing.

[B]NOTES:[/B] Are you a user?  please report your fails on the relevant threads.
Are you a developer? use the templating system to add yourself as a "known" application.

Probably other apps exist and have issues.... If you find one we missed? Let us know.[/COLOR][/spoiler][/COLOR]

[B]HOW DO I UPGRADE FROM AN EARLIER ONE? [/B]
[COLOR="Gray"][I]No need to touch MKK.[/I][/COLOR]
Replace the old KUAL-KDK-[I](1|2)[/I].0.azw2 file in the [I]documents[/I] folder with the new one.
[B]NOTE:[/B] If you're upgrading from a version older than 2.3, remove the deprecated [B]KindleLauncher-[I](1|2)[/I].0.azw2[/B] file in the process.
The correct, up to date filename is now [B]KUAL-KDK-[I](1|2)[/I].0.azw2[/B] ;).
That's everything. [COLOR="Gray"][I]You can find the new one in the KUAL files below[/I][/COLOR]
